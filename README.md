## Project Overview

This repository simplifies network operations by providing reusable automation components for common tasks such as device configuration, API-driven management, and health monitoring. Whether you're working with Cisco, F5, or other vendors, this toolkit accelerates workflows and reduces manual effort.

---

## Features

- **Ansible Playbooks and Roles** for automated device configuration and orchestration  
- **Python Scripts** for API interaction and automation tasks  
- **Bash Utilities** for quick CLI-based tools  
- **Postman Collections** to validate and test REST APIs  
- Modular, environment-agnostic, and extensible design

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- Ansible 2.9+  
- Git  
- Postman (optional)

### Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/zupm-dot/network-automation.git

# Navigate into the repo
cd network-automation

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required Python dependencies (if needed)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Navigate to `ansible/playbooks/` to run playbooks for network configuration.
- Add or edit roles in `ansible/roles/` to match your devices and environments.
- Use scripts under `python/` for API-based automation.
- Use tools under `bash/` for quick testing and command-line workflows.
- Import Postman collections under `postman/` to test or demo REST API integrations.
